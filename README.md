# flagUtils

This repo holds all necessary scripts to reduce, calibrate, and perform basic analysis on FLAG spectral line data. This README provides basic info on each of the contained scripts as well as syntactically correct examples. These scripts are specifically set up to be used within the GBO computing environment. 


## Getting Started

Again, many of the constituent scripts are designed to work specifically within the GBO computing environment. Much of the directory paths are hard coded, so one must change these manually. To get set up, clone the repo within your desired directory:
git clone https://github.com/nipingel/flagUtils.git

### Prerequisites

These scripts are written for python, GBTIDL, and bash. 

### Installing

only a simple 'git clone' should be necessary
